# Post-Compact Recovery Guidance

**Date Created**: June 6, 2025 (UNIT 3)  
**Framework**: Trinity Framework 2.0 Compliant âœ“

## Overview

This document provides guidance for recovering context after a compact event during the Trinity Apex website AWS Amplify migration. It outlines key resources, current status, and next steps to quickly resume work on the migration.

## Current Migration Status

As of June 6, 2025 (UNIT 3), the Trinity Apex website AWS Amplify migration is in the following state:

1. **Backend Resources**: âœ… DEPLOYED
   - CloudFormation stack: trinity-apex-contact-backend
   - Lambda function: TrinityApexContactFormProcessor
   - API Gateway: https://7nidg8yryi.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/contact
   - DynamoDB table: TrinityApexContactSubmissions
   - SES email verification: Completed for apex@trinity-apex.com

2. **Frontend Resources**: âœ… DEPLOYED
   - Amplify app: trinity-apex-website (ID: d1lr9hil3wn2il)
   - GitHub integration: Connected to jlchatha/trinity-apex-website
   - Contact form: Implemented and connected to API endpoint
   - Build configuration: Implemented via amplify.yml

3. **Domain Configuration**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
   - DNS records: Updated at Porkbun
   - ACM certificate: Pending validation
   - DNS propagation: In progress
   - Domain availability: Not yet complete

## Key Documentation Resources

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| README.md | Current status overview | Repository root |
| FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md | Detailed implementation status | Repository root |
| BACKEND-RESOURCES.md | Backend configuration details | Repository root |
| DNS-UPDATE-PROCEDURE.md | DNS update instructions | Repository root |
| STATUS.md | Trinity HISTORIAN status tracking | ../trinity-historian-workspace/ |
| AUTO-COMPACT.md | Primary recovery document | ../trinity-historian-workspace/ |

## Immediate Recovery Steps

1. **Check Domain Verification Status**:
   ```bash
   /home/alreadyinuse/git/trinity-mvp-historian/trinity-apex-website/scripts/monitor-dns-propagation.sh
   ```

2. **Check CloudFormation Stack Status**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name trinity-apex-contact-backend
   ```

3. **Check Amplify App Status**:
   ```bash
   aws amplify get-app --app-id d1lr9hil3wn2il
   ```
   Note: If this fails, use the AWS Console URL:
   https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-west-2#/d1lr9hil3wn2il

## UNIT 4 Pending Tasks

The following tasks remain to be completed during UNIT 4:

1. **Domain Verification**:
   - Monitor certificate validation progress
   - Verify domain availability once propagation completes
   - Update documentation with final domain status

2. **Contact Form Testing**:
   - Test form submission once domain is accessible
   - Verify email delivery
   - Check DynamoDB for stored submissions

3. **Final Verification**:
   - Complete post-migration testing checklist
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Check all pages and functionality

4. **Documentation Finalization**:
   - Update all documentation with final status
   - Create monitoring and maintenance procedures
   - Document lessons learned and best practices

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Certificate Validation Delays**:
   - Issue: ACM certificate validation taking longer than expected
   - Solution: Verify DNS records are correctly set at Porkbun
   - Alternative: If validation fails after 24 hours, request manual validation in ACM console

2. **DNS Propagation Issues**:
   - Issue: DNS records updated but not propagating
   - Solution: Check TTL values and verify record format
   - Alternative: Use different DNS providers to check propagation status

3. **Contact Form Errors**:
   - Issue: Form submissions failing
   - Solution: Check Lambda CloudWatch logs for errors
   - Check CORS configuration in API Gateway

## Critical Paths

If recovery occurs during UNIT 4 implementation, prioritize these critical path items:

1. Domain verification and availability
2. Contact form functionality testing
3. Final documentation updates

## Recovery Success Criteria

Context recovery will be successful when:

1. Current migration status is clearly understood
2. Remaining tasks are identified and prioritized
3. Any in-progress operations are properly tracked
4. Implementation can proceed without duplicating work
